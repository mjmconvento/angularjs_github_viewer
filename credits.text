Credits to the youtube user I've watched regarding AngularJS.
Sadly, I tried to search his video again but couldn't find it anymore.
I didn't took down who the username is, but the tutorial series he made about angular is also a github-viewer.
I've followed his tutorial then I've just edited the fields and added some bootstrap elements in this project.
If knew who he is, then let me know.
I'll make sure to give him credits.
